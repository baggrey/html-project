        <h4>Here is a time line of Martin Luther King Jr</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>1929</b>: Martin Luther King, Jr. was born in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of a Baptist minister.</li>
            <li><b>1955</b>: He received a doctorate degree in theology and helped to organize the first major protest
                of the
                African American civil rights movement. This successful protest was code named “Montgomery Bus Boycott”.
                Influenced by Mohandas Gandhi, he advocated civil disobedience and nonviolent resistance to segregation
                in the South. The peaceful protests he led throughout the American South were often met with violence,
                but King and his followers persisted, and the movement gained momentum.</li>
            <li><b>1963</b>: Bayard Rustin and A. Philip Randolph led the massive March on Washington for Jobs and
                Freedom; the
                event’s grand finale was King’s famous “I Have a Dream” speech. Two hundred and fifty thousand people
                gathered outside the Lincoln Memorial to hear the stirring speech.</li>
            <li><b>1964</b>: The civil rights movement achieved two of its greatest successes: the ratification of the
                24th
                Amendment, which abolished the poll tax, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited racial
                discrimination in employment and education and outlawed racial segregation in public facilities. Later
                that year, King became the youngest person to win the Nobel Peace Prize (in 2014 Malala Yousafzai became
                the youngest to receive the prize at age 17).</li>
            <li><b>1968</b>: In the late 1960s, King openly criticized U.S. involvement in Vietnam and turned his
                efforts to
                winning economic rights for poor Americans. He was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 4, 1968.
